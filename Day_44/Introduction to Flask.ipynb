    "# Introduction to Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It is known for its simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to create web applications with ease. Flask is designed to be extensible and allows you to add only the components you need, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of Python programming\n",
    "- Understanding of web development concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)\n",
    "- Python installed on your machine (version 3.6 or above)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "   First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python --version\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   To install Flask, you will use pip, the Python package installer. Run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install flask\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Project Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a directory for your Flask project and navigate into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir flask_project\n",
    "   cd flask_project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m venv venv\n",
    "   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Your First Flask Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Application File**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Inside your project directory, create a new file named `app.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.route('/')\n",
    "   def hello_world():\n",
    "       return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "   if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "       app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is the simplest Flask application. It imports the Flask class, creates an instance of it, and defines a single route that returns a \"Hello, World!\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Application**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run your Flask application by executing the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python app.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Flask will start a local development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the \"Hello, World!\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Flask Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routes and View Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes are used to map URLs to functions in your Flask app. The `@app.route('/')` decorator is used to bind a function to a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/about')\n",
    "def about():\n",
    "    return 'This is the about page'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to render HTML templates. Create a `templates` directory in your project and add an HTML file named `index.html`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!doctype html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <title>{{ title }}</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <h1>{{ heading }}</h1>\n",
    "    <p>{{ message }}</p>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify `app.py` to render this template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html', title='Home Page', heading='Welcome to Flask', message='This is a Flask web application')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Forms and Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask can handle various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.). Create a simple form in `templates/form.html`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!doctype html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <form action=\"/submit\" method=\"post\">\n",
    "      <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n",
    "      <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\">\n",
    "      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n",
    "    </form>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Update `app.py` to handle form submissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import request\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/form')\n",
    "def form():\n",
    "    return render_template('form.html')\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def submit():\n",
    "    name = request.form['name']\n",
    "    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask automatically serves static files from the `static` directory. Create a `static` folder and add a CSS file, `style.css`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "body {\n",
    "  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Link this CSS file in your `index.html`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides a basic introduction to Flask. You should now have a working Flask application with routing, template rendering, form handling, and static files. Flask has many extensions for database integration, form validation, authentication, and more, which you can explore as you continue learning.\n",
