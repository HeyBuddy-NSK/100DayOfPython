    "_Slicing_ in python is a technique used to access a specific portion or subset of a sequence, such as a string, list or tuple. It allows us to extract a range of elements by specifying a start and end index, and optionally a step value, to control how the slicing is performed.\n",

    "- **Definition**: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be defined at the module level and is not bound to any object.\n",

    "- **Usage**: Can be called by its name directly in the code.\n",

    "### Method\n",
    "- **Definition**: A method is a function that is associated with an object or class. It operates on the data contained within that object or class and is defined within a class.\n",
    "- **Syntax**: Defined using the `def` keyword inside a class definition.\n",

    "  - Functions do not have `self`.\n",

    "**Unit tests** in Python are tests that focus on verifying the functionality of individual units of code, such as functions or methods, to ensure they work as expected. They are a fundamental part of testing and help ensure that each part of your codebase performs correctly in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About Unit Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To test individual units of code (usually functions or methods) in isolation from the rest of the codebase to ensure they produce the correct output for given inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Framework**: Python's built-in `unittest` module provides tools for creating and running unit tests. Other popular frameworks include `pytest` and `nose`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure**: Unit tests are typically organized into test cases, which are classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`. Each test case contains methods that test specific aspects of the unit of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assertions**: Inside test methods, you use assertion methods (like `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, etc.) to check if the actual output matches the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Using `unittest`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to be tested\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unit test case\n",
    "class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)\n",

    "# Run the tests\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    unittest.main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Tests focus on small, isolated pieces of code.\n",
    "- **Automation**: Tests can be automated to run frequently, especially during development and integration.\n",
    "- **Regression Testing**: Helps catch regressions by ensuring previously working code continues to function correctly.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Provides a form of documentation on how functions and methods are expected to behave.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of Scope in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Scope**:\n",
    "   - Variables defined within a function or block are in the local scope.\n",
    "   - Accessible only within that function or block.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def my_function():\n",
    "         x = 10  # Local scope\n",

    "     print(x)  # Error: x is not defined outside the function\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enclosing Scope** (Nonlocal scope):\n",
    "   - Applies to nested functions.\n",
    "   - Refers to the scope of the outer function containing a nested function.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def outer_function():\n",
    "         y = 20  # Enclosing scope\n",
    "         def inner_function():\n",
    "             print(y)  # Accessible within the inner function\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global Scope**:\n",
    "   - Variables defined at the top level of a script or module, outside any function or block, are in the global scope.\n",
    "   - Accessible from anywhere in the module.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     z = 30  # Global scope\n",
    "     def my_function():\n",
    "         print(z)  # Accessible here\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Built-in Scope**:\n",
    "   - Refers to the scope of Python's built-in names, such as `len()`, `print()`, etc.\n",
    "   - These are always accessible unless overridden by a local variable.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # len is a built-in function\n",

    "An **interpreted language** is a type of programming language in which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without the need to compile the program into machine-language instructions first. In an interpreted language, code is translated and executed line by line at runtime by an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Interpreted Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Execution**:\n",
    "   - Code is executed directly from the source without being converted into a machine-level binary beforehand.\n",
    "   - Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Platform Independence**:\n",
    "   - Since the interpreter executes the code, the same source code can run on different platforms as long as the interpreter is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Allows dynamic typing, easy debugging, and interactive coding, making it flexible for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Slower Execution**:\n",
    "   - Generally slower than compiled languages because the interpreter translates code at runtime.\n",

    "   - Reduces the development cycle time as there’s no need for a separate compilation step. \n",

    "A **dynamically typed language** is a programming language in which the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile-time. This means you don't have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you define it; the interpreter automatically infers the type based on the value assigned to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Dynamically Typed Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Need for Explicit Type Declarations**:\n",
    "   - You can assign a value to a variable without specifying its type. The type is determined by the value itself.\n",
    "   - Example in Python:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     x = 10       # x is an integer\n",
    "     x = \"Hello\"  # Now x is a string\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Variables can be reassigned to different types of values throughout their lifetime.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     y = 3.14     # y is a float\n",
    "     y = [1, 2, 3]  # Now y is a list\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Runtime Type Checking**:\n",
    "   - Type checking is done at runtime, meaning that errors related to type mismatches may only be caught when the code is executed.\n",
    "   - This can lead to more flexibility but may also result in runtime errors if types are not handled carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplified Syntax**:\n",
    "   - Since you don’t need to specify types, the syntax is often cleaner and simpler, making the code easier to write and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common in Interpreted Languages**:\n",
    "   - Dynamically typed languages are often, but not always, interpreted. Examples include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 10)       # Works with integers\n",
    "result = add(\"Hello, \", \"world!\")  # Works with strings\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `add` function works with both integers and strings because Python determines the type of the arguments at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Allows quick prototyping and easy changes in code.\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Reduces the boilerplate code by not requiring explicit type definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Runtime Errors**: Type-related errors may only show up at runtime.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Can be slower than statically typed languages due to the overhead of type checking at runtime."
