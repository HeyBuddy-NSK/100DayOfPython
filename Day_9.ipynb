    "Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. To install Python, download the installer from python.org and follow the installation instructions. Basic syntax involves using indentation to denote blocks of code and writing statements line by line. Variables are used to store data, and data types include integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc. Basic input/output operations involve functions like input() and print().\n",
